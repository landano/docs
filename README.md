# Introducing Landano

Landano unlocks a $1+ trillion sales opportunity in the global real estate market by giving Bitcoin holders access to land investments for the first time.&#x20;

As one of the first Bitcoin RWA (Real-World Asset) projects, Landano transforms land ownership by tokenizing property titles using Cardano NFTs and mirroring them on Bitcoin as Rune tokens.

This cross-chain design—powered by a Wanchain bridge—combines the decentralized security of Bitcoin with the smart contract functionality of Cardano, creating a secure, verifiable, and tradable framework for land rights. It offers institutional-grade trust and scalable infrastructure for land registries, governments, and investors worldwide.

With over 24,000 land records already uploaded to the Cardano testnet and pilot programs underway in Africa, Landano is leading the charge in real estate tokenization—bringing secure property rights, DeFi-enabled land finance, and economic inclusion to billions.
