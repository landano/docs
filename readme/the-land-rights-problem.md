# The land rights problem

Land and home insecurity is a global problem with some estimates that 5.5 billion people (70% of earth's population) have legal rights to their land or homes but the lack the records to prove it. One billion of this number reported living in daily fear of losing their land, home, shop or farm. Without this documentation they face long-term insecurity and a critical barrier to building family wealth.

Many centralized, government-run land tenure systems are falling short. They are difficult to access and tend to be expensive, time-consuming, and opaque. \
