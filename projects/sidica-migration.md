# SiDiCa migration

A very large bulk upload of land right records minted as Landano NFTs\
\
This project was Funded through Project Catalyst F8. It has experienced significant delays but is close to delivering concrete results.\
\
This project is a collaboration between Landano International and Terra Firma land right consultancy in Mozambique.  Terra Firma approached Landano to help connect its various databases of land right records to new DeFi opportunities by tokenizing its records as Cardano NFTs.\

This was originally intended to be a database of approximately 80k Mozambican land right declarations and cadastral records. However, a variety of political pressures, grant requirements, and technical delays meant this migration no longer became feasible.\
\
Instead, Terra Firma developed a more streamlined version of its land right declration tool and tested it with a similar market in Zambia. This process provided a good test case for a more user-centric applicaiton interface and functionality.\
\
Landano will complete the original investigation with this set of \`?? k Zambian records. The identities have  been protected. The main intent was to demonstrate NFT mintining process and provide good practice examples of what a a high quality RWA product looks like on Cardano .\
