# Administer land rights



* **Use case:** Administer land rights
* **Actor/user:** Land Administrator
* **Preconditions:** Land parcel has been surveyed and the relevant cadastral data has been collected.
* **Regular steps/standard path:** The Land Administrator creates a land parcel record and identifies the rights that can be granted for it. The Land Administrator responds to requests to purchase land rights by approving the creation of a new land right NFT or the transfer of existing ones.
* **Alternative paths:** The Land Administrator rejects a land right purchase request. The Land Administrator revokes an existing land right when terms are not met.
* **Postconditions:** Land parcels and their cadastral data are searchable.  It is easy to verify whether a given person holds a particular land right for a parcel of land.
