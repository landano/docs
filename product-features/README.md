# Product Features

### 1. Decentralized Land Registry

Transactions and ownership records are stored on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring immutability and security. This means landowners no longer have to rely on paper-based records, which can be lost, stolen, or forged.

### 2. Smart Contracts

Automates land transactions, lease agreements, tax collection and other land administration processes. These smart contracts ensure trustless transactions, meaning neither party can manipulate the agreement once it is deployed. For instance, a farmer leasing a plot can have an automated rental payment system that transfers funds only when predefined conditions are met.

### 3. Mobile & Desktop Interfaces

Landowners and administrators can easily access and manage property records through intuitive mobile and web applications. This provides accessibility even in rural areas where mobile penetration is higher than desktop usage. A landowner in Mozambique, for example, can verify ownership or initiate a transaction from their smartphone.

### 4. Customary Land Rights Validation

Local chiefs and authorities authenticate land records, ensuring trust and legitimacy. Land ownership in many African communities is based on traditional governance structures, and Landano integrates these customary leaders into the blockchain verification process. This prevents disputes and enhances adoption at the grassroots level.

### 5. Collateralization & DeFi Integration

Land records can be used for microloans and decentralized finance (DeFi) lending. This enables landowners to unlock the financial value of their property, even if they do not have formal bank access. For example, a smallholder farmer can use their digitally registered land as collateral to secure funding for crops without needing a traditional bank loan.

### 6. Map and List Views

Users can view land records through interactive maps or lists, filtering plots by ownership, land type, and transaction status. This provides a clearer visual representation of property distribution and ownership history. For instance, a land buyer can search for available plots in a specific region using predefined filters.

### 7. Identity Verification & Privacy

Ensuring KYC/AML compliance with encrypted financial and personal data, including masked identity numbers where required by law. This protects users from fraud and unauthorized access. For example, only verified landowners and approved buyers can engage in transactions, reducing fraudulent claims.

### 8. Smart NFT Land Records

Each land parcel is tokenized as an NFT, creating a tamper-proof digital asset representing ownership. This means ownership can be transferred instantly and securely without reliance on paper documentation. A landowner in Kenya could tokenize their land and sell it via the blockchain without physical paperwork.

### 9. Land Transfers & Payments

Users can initiate peer-to-peer land transactions securely, with designated authorities providing approval where necessary. This process eliminates the need for costly intermediaries. For instance, a property sale can be executed entirely on-chain, reducing transfer time from months to minutes.

### 10. Official Document Upload & Verification

Landowners and administrators can upload scanned copies of land agreements and ownership certificates, which are securely stored and linked to their digital records. This ensures a digital backup for all critical documents. For example, a government agency could verify and timestamp land deeds to prevent future disputes.

### 11. Automated Plot Activity Log

A detailed transaction history is maintained for each land parcel, ensuring transparency in ownership changes and land use. This allows for full traceability of property records. A farmer leasing land could track the full history of past leases and ownership transitions.

### 12. Seamless Registration and Onboarding

New users can register with email, phone, and verification documents, with guided onboarding tours available to help them navigate the platform. This ensures easy adoption even for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology.

### 13. Integrated Payment Processing

Secure transactions for land purchases, lease payments, and registry fees, with receipts stored for future reference. Users can make payments using fiat or cryptocurrency, ensuring broad accessibility. For instance, a buyer can pay for land using mobile money or stablecoins, with all transactions recorded on the blockchain.
